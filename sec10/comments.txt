Please print this, but // this is a comment, ignore

Now we can have "Comment characters like // or /* inside a string which should print */"

But quotes in a /* comment should be "slashed"
multiline comments should be ignored 
as 
well */ hi

Now '/' is a character constant that might look like the start of a comment, but it's not so you should see all of this.

Same with '"'--it is not the start of a quote, so // this comment should be hidden!

And escape characters "Should \"always be printed and not change the quote status so /* you should see this */"
